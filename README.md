🚀 Unlocking the Machine Failure with Machine Learning..! 🚀

Hello #LinkedInFam,

I'm excited to unveil my recent project (PoC): "Predicting
the Machine Failure with the application of Machine Learning Algorithms"
Leveraging AI to revolutionize Machine Predictive Maintenance, trying to push the boundaries and ensuring a smarter, more efficient future..! 🚀

🛠️ Technologies Applied:
👉 Python
👉 Pandas
👉 NumPy
👉 Matplotlib
👉 Scikit-learn

📚 Project Overview:
👉 Data Loading: Fetched the Machine Prediction Dataset into Pandas DataFrame
👉 Data Preprocessing: Applied label encoding to convert "Type of Failures" to numerical labels
👉 Data Exploration: Utilized data preparation library i.e., EDA for comprehensive reporting and statistical summaries, implemented statistical measurements of relationship to check strength between variables
👉 Feature selection: Extracted (selected) right predictors for effective model training
👉 Splitting the data into test/train datasets

📊 Data Visualization:
👉 Employed Matplotlib to visualize feature distributions..

🤖 Below Machine Learning Algorithms are implemented to get the maximum accuracy for Precision, Recall & F1 scores:
👉 Logistic Regression
👉 Decision Trees
👉 Random Forest
👉 AdaBoost
👉 XGBoost
👉 KNN
👉 Support Vector Machines

📈 What's Next?
👉 Hyperparameter tuning
👉 Error handling

✅ Deployment of the Model:
👉 The algorithm chosen for deployment is the "XGBoost" model 🎯, representing the final selection in our decision-making process..!
👉 Based on the trials made for different algorithms XGBoost produced the best average accuracy of 96%..! 🚀
👉 Given that the dataset pertains to Machine Failure Prediction, it is noteworthy that 97% of the machines exhibit no failures. Conversely, the data reveals that 3% of the machines experience various types of failures..
👉 The objective of this algorithm is to forecast the type of Machine Failure, placing emphasis on the accuracy metrics of "Precision", "Recall" & "F1-Score"...💯
